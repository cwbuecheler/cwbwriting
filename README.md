I can't really see any reason anyone would want to use this site other than mmmmaybe to get an idea for how eleventy works. If that's the case, you can use the following commands:

- `npm start` to start the eleventy server and serve static pages at http://localhost:8080/
- `npm sass` to run sass compiling
- `npm gulp` to run javascript minimizing

Feel free to reach out if you have questions about anything. I'm not hard to find!
