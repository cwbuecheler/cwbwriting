  Why don't you minify your HTML?

  Because I love view source. It's how I learned to make websites.
  I don't think there's enough of a performance gain, even on slow connections,
  for minifying HTML to make much of a difference. I do minify CSS and JS, but
  if you'd like to see the unminified versions of those files, please reach
  out and I'll be happy to provide them!

<h4>So, what are you all about, Chris?</h4>
<p>I'm flattered, truly. Let's start with my standard author bio:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christopher Buecheler is a novelist, a web developer, an award-winning amateur mixologist, a developing illustrator, a player of the guitar and drums, an enjoyer of video games, and an NBA enthusiast. He lives a semi-nomadic existence with his wonderful French wife and their two cats, Carbomb and Baron Salvatore H. Lynx II. Currently they reside in Providence, RI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from all that, I'm in my mid-forties, I listen to a fairly narrow spectrum of mostly rock music, I work out and run on weekdays, I'm vocally progressive, and I spend too much time on BlueSky.</p>
<h4>Semi-Nomadic?</h4>
<p>I've been based in Providence for eleven years, which is the longest I've lived in a single location in my entire life. Not counting moves to a new place within the same city, I've lived in twelve towns across six states and one other country: Massachusetts, New York (upstate and city), California, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Rhode Island, and France. I also travel frequently, particularly to Europe. I regularly work and write on these trips, so as a whole the lifestyle feels fairly nomadic. But we do spend a lot of time in Providence! Thus the <em>semi</em>.</p>
<h4>What about this web developer stuff?</h4>
<p>I've been designing and building websites professionally for twenty-five years. It pays the bills, and it's also something I actually enjoy doing. I designed and built this site using custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown, and the static site generator Eleventy. If you want to learn more about my work, you can check out <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/cwbuecheler" target="_blank">my LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<h4>Cool, cool. And the hobbies?</h4>
<p>You can learn about all of this stuff in more depth at <a href="https://cwbuecheler.com" target="_blank">cwbuecheler.com</a> but here's the summary: In my spare time, I like to attempt to do many things decently instead of a few things well (and also play a lot of video games). To that end, in addition to the web stuff, which is a job, and the writing, which is basically a second job, I also regularly work on my drawing skills using an iPad Pro and an Apple pencil and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cwbuecheler/" target="_blank">post the results to instagram</a>, and I periodically play my guitars (An <a href="https://www.chorder.com/electric-guitars/epiphone/elitist-les-paul-standard-plus-234" target="_blank">Epiphone Elitest Les Paul Standard Plus</a>, a <a href="https://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/214ce" target="_blank">Taylor 214CE</a>, and a <a href="https://glguitars.com/product/l-2000-2/" target="_blank">G&amp;L Tribute L-2000</a>). I don't currently have a drum set, because I don't currently have a place to put a drum set, but I hope someday to rectify both situations. The cocktailing has taken a backseat in recent years. I mean, I still <em>drink</em> them, but I used to write <a href="https://www.primermagazine.com/author/christopher-buecheler" target="_blank">cocktail and spirits articles for Primer Magazine</a>, and I ran a nightly cocktail blog, <a href="https://drinkshouts.com" target="_blank">DrinkShouts</a>, for a while, which also allowed me to learn a good bit about photography, including the fact that I didn't like photography enough to continue pursuing it as a hobby! I also, of course, read frequently, especially in the genres in which I write.</p>
<p>Oh, and the video games thing. Here are my top ten ever and my current favorites, which should give you a good look into my preferences:</p>
