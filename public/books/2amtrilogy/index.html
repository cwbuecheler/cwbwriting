  Why don't you minify your HTML?

  Because I love view source. It's how I learned to make websites.
  I don't think there's enough of a performance gain, even on slow connections,
  for minifying HTML to make much of a difference. I do minify CSS and JS, but
  if you'd like to see the unminified versions of those files, please reach
  out and I'll be happy to provide them!

<div class="image-cover-trilogy ir"><a href="/books/2amtrilogy/"><img srcset="/_img/books/trilogy_sm@2x.jpg 2x, /_img/books/trilogy_sm.jpg 1x" src="/_img/books/trilogy_sm.jpg" alt="The 2 AM Trilogy Cover Image" /></a></div>
<p>The 2 AM Trilogy is a set of action-oriented vampire novels that have received a lot of love from tens of thousands of fans around the world. They can be purchased as individual stories, or as a collected trilogy at a moderate discount. The first book in the series is completely free, in either case.</p>
<p><strong>Book 1 – <a href="/books/thebloodthatbonds">The Blood That Bonds</a></strong></p>
<p>Two is trapped. She’s hooked on heroin, held as property, forced to sell her body to feed the addiction. Time brings her ever closer to what seems an inevitable death and Two waits, uncaring, longing only for the next fix.</p>
<p>That’s when Theroen arrives, beckoning to his Ferrari and grinning his inscrutable grin. He is handsome. Confident. Eager to help lift her out of the life that’s grinding her down.</p>
<p>The only problem? Theroen is a vampire.</p>
<p>His blood can cure her addiction, grant her powers she has never had, change her forever into something greater than she was. But when he sinks his teeth into her neck, Theroen also thrusts Two into a world of danger, madness and despair. The powerful elder Abraham will use her arrival to shatter the uneasy peace that exists in his mansion, bringing an end to the dark game he has been playing for centuries.</p>

Two must deal with the machinations of the vampire council, while Tori must make a decision that will change not only her life, but the lives of all of the vampires in America, and perhaps the world …</p>

<h3>Praise for The 2 AM Trilogy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This is such an amazing series with a variety of different types of vampires. Two is an extraordinary girl, rising from a dark place in her life, growing through bad experiences and hard times, and becoming a powerful person. The people in her life are equally important, each shaping the world where vampires lurk in plain sight. The people that hunt them are viscous and have acquired a powerful weapon, and it is up to Two and her friends to find a way to survive.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
