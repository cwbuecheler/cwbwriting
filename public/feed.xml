    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the missing the July update. It turns out when you lose your job with five days&#39; notice (and three of those are a long weekend), you kind of go into scramble mode, and your hobbies and/or semi-professional work have to go on hold while you look for, find, interview for, accept, and start at a new job. Especially when you add a preexisting trip to France, getting COVID for the first time after two and a half years, and being the Best Man in a wedding into the mix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve been busy. Which means a short update this month … but that&#39;s okay! Let&#39;s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unending Agent Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I talked extensively about the agent search and how it works in the last newsletter. Not gonna rehash that here, but I will go over the major thing happening right now: I&#39;ve had an agent request revisions on my latest book, Piety the Knife. I meant to make them over the last two or three months but, well, the first paragraph of this email happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I&#39;m a bit more back in the saddle. I&#39;m once again going over all of the notes (the agent&#39;s and my own) and preparing to take a stab at a third draft of the book. I have no idea how long it&#39;s going to take me to round it into shape, and I have a lot of other stuff going on in my life right now, but with summer winding down I&#39;m hoping to find enough time to hack away at it. So, let&#39;s see where we are in two months. Hopefully much further along than reading notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also kicking around ideas for two new books, because of course I am. One of them would be straight historical fiction with no fantasy elements (or very minor ones). The other would be a horror story but with a pretty significant twist that I don&#39;t want to discuss just yet. I&#39;m still figuring out how it would work! Probably won&#39;t get to either of those this year, but they&#39;ve definitely been rolling around in my brain while I run, or shower, or am doing stuff like mowing the lawn, which is how my books always start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Websiii-heee-iiitte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After literally years of owning CWBWriting.com, I finally put a website up there! It includes information on all of my books and stories, an occasionally-updated blog, some stuff about me, and so forth. Also it has a light and dark mode and will remember your preference, because what kind of web developer would I be if I didn&#39;t offer dark mode in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swing by! Check it out! Maybe subscribe to the RSS feed in case I ever post anything there that&#39;s not just a duplicate of this newsletter! Exclamation points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And … that&#39;s really about it for this month. See you in November!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can get these updates before they hit the blog by subscribing to the newsletter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to CWB Writing | Post | CWB Writing</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to CWB Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many failed attempts to get this site off the ground, I&#39;ve finally found the time and energy to get this site off the ground! I felt it was time that my writing had its own dedicated spot on the web, rather than existing as a tab on my personal site alongside such exciting information as what basketball team I like to root for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I intend to update this site semi-regularly with writing news, thoughts, tips, info, etc. At the very least, it&#39;ll get updated every couple of months when I post my bi-monthly writing newsletter, though I should point out that you&#39;ll get these at least a week early if you subscribe using the box that is either to your right (on larger screens) or down below (on phones and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&#39;m working on some requested revisions to &lt;em&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-may-2022/&quot;&gt;see this update&lt;/a&gt;) and starting to think about my next story. Right now I&#39;m kicking around a couple of ideas, one of which is the story of someone who isn&#39;t the CHOSEN ONE but hangs out with the CHOSEN ONE, and one of which is about the Late Bronze Age collapse and the mysterious &amp;quot;Sea People&amp;quot; who may&#39;ve caused it. Maybe I&#39;ll merge those two into one thing. Or maybe I&#39;ll write something else entirely. You never know until you start putting words on digital paper!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CWB Writing Newsletter - May 2022 | Post | CWB Writing</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello There!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an interesting couple of months it&#39;s been. I don&#39;t have &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news, but I do have &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; news, which is … well, not bad! Let&#39;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unending Agent Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s talk about the agent hunt. For those new to this newsletter or who&#39;ve forgotten how this goes, it works like this: I send out &amp;quot;queries&amp;quot; which are single page descriptions of the new book, usually along with some information about yourself. Most (but not all) agents also ask you to send a small sample of the book, ranging from the first five pages to the first three chapters. MOST queries end up in rejections (or &amp;quot;closed, no response&amp;quot; because some agents only respond when they want more). I follow a lot of agents on Twitter and many of them get over 1,000 queries in a given month. Ambitious agents might take on six or seven authors in a given &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;. The odds are always against the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the agent is interested, they will generally ask for a &amp;quot;partial&amp;quot; (more of the book but not the whole thing) or a &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; (the full manuscript). An agent who asked for a partial will either reject or, if interested, upgrade to a full. Once an agent has read the full, one of three things will happen: they will either pass on representing the work, they will ask for revisions, or they will offer representation. The latter is the goal, though it only represents one more step on a very long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO … with all that in mind, let&#39;s talk numbers. I have sent out a whopping &lt;em&gt;seventy&lt;/em&gt; queries for my latest book, Piety the Knife, a dark fantasy novel. Of those queries, so far thirty-six have resulted in rejections with no page requests, and two in &amp;quot;closed, no response.&amp;quot; That cuts us down to thirty-two. Of which, 26 are still outstanding. That means six agents have so far requested at least a partial manuscript (in fact, I got five full requests and one partial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those six have offered representation. One rejected on the partial. Three others rejected on the full. One is still outstanding but is probably a reject at this point. The final agent has requested revisions, but does believe that if I can get the story to where she thinks it needs to be to sell it, she would like to represent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this is a very good result. It&#39;s actually a spectacular result. Six requests for pages is the most I&#39;ve ever gotten on any book I&#39;ve ever queried, including Elixir, the novel that landed me my first agent. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of the agents who rejected after requesting the full sent personalized feedback saying they thought I was a talented writer and to make sure I query them with my next book if I&#39;m still seeking representation. That&#39;s a really good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;revise and resubmit&amp;quot; (R&amp;amp;R) is the best sign of the bunch. This gives me an actual target. &amp;quot;If you can do what&#39;s needed, you will likely get an agent.&amp;quot; I spent over two hours on Zoom with the agent in question, and I&#39;m extremely confident that a) she&#39;s well read in the genres I write, b) she&#39;s very passionate about the genres I write, and c) she would be an excellent champion for the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now: the hard part. Rewrites. I&#39;ve spent the past couple of weeks working on a plan to get the book into shape, taking into account her feedback, her assistant&#39;s feedback, my wife&#39;s thoughts, and my own gut instincts. I&#39;m just about ready to begin chopping, adding, and changing. I don&#39;t expect the process to be lengthy, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; expect it to be difficult. Writing is hard work. But this is as close as I&#39;ve been in a while to finding representation for my books, and the goal remains the same: get an agent, get a book sold to publishers, get that book on the shelves. I&#39;ve wanted it since I was eleven years old. Gonna keep pursuing it till it happens, or I&#39;m dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got this month. See you in July, hopefully with good news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;
