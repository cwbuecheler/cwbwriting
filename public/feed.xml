    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Warning: Loss of Pet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long post and there is nothing new or revelatory in it – any pet owner who&#39;s experienced this loss will have a similar story, and I&#39;m unsure that it&#39;s of particular interest to anyone but myself. That said, writing is part of how I work through things, and I need to work through this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday morning, February 6th 2023, my wife and I got up and went about our normal routines. She was working from home due to a pipe break at her school. I was working at home because I have worked from home full-time since 2011. We went about our morning routine. I worked out, ran, and took a shower. She fed the cats—Carbomb, a female tortie almost 17 years old, and Baron Salvatore H. Lynx II, a male Maine coon almost 15 years old—made coffee and breakfast for herself, and got set up to work from her office upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime shortly after my shower, Carbomb made a strange noise and then barfed up her breakfast. This was, in itself, not a terribly unusual event. She&#39;s been a pukey cat her entire life, prone to scarfing and barfing (yes, we&#39;d checked with multiple vets about it, and their response was a uniform &amp;quot;there&#39;s nothing wrong with her, some cats just puke a lot&amp;quot;). So, we cleaned things up and went about our day, until about an hour later we noticed she was behaving oddly. She was unsteady on her feet, didn&#39;t seem to realize where she was, and kept getting stuck in corners and then giving a single upset shout about it. Because she was an old cat, and because it was such a wide swing in behavior even from the previous morning, we scheduled a vet appointment that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little background: We adopted Carbomb in the spring of 2007, when she was about a year old. We went to the ASPCA on the upper east side of Manhattan with the intention of finding a cat, walked into the cat room, and she leapt down from a perch and walked on top of several other, less enthusiastic cats to greet us. We did at least &amp;quot;interview&amp;quot; a few other cats but the deal was pretty much sealed from the start. She was the one. We called her Carbomb because her fur was the color of Guinness, Bailey&#39;s, and Jameson. She&#39;d been a constant part of our life for nearly sixteen years, moving with us from Manhattan, to Brooklyn, to Indianapolis, to Providence, and even making a six-month trip with us to Paris (her brother was also there for all of the stops except Manhattan).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbomb had been acting &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; for several months at this point. She had trouble getting up on the couch, and her counter-hopping days were years past. She had become picky about where she spent her time, living mostly in her heated bed or on the couch in my office (the warmest room in the house). She would still chase treats if we bounced them along our hardwood floor, but she mostly found them by sound and movement. If they came to a complete stop, she would lose them. She had no major health issues that we knew about, although a few months ago we did find her holed up and looking unwell at the bottom of our front stairs, the coldest part of our house (a trip to the animal ER showed nothing wrong with her bloodwork, and only that she was a bit dehydrated). So, nothing crazy for a cat that was pushing seventeen. We figured her eyes were just going a bit, the way her legs had been for years now. She was still a vibrant, active, responsive cat. Now, very suddenly, she wasn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vet inspected her and diagnosed her with, essentially, &amp;quot;seizure hangover&amp;quot; - she thought Carbomb had experienced a significant seizure that morning (thus the weird noise before the puking) and was still recovering. Typically, she said, the recovery would take a day or so, though there was no guarantee how complete it would be, or that it would happen at all. When Charlotte asked her what the likely cause was, she said unfortunately the most likely cause was brain tumors (not necessarily cancerous), but it wouldn&#39;t be possible to know without doing an MRI. Charlotte said she&#39;d talk everything over with me, and brought Carbomb home. The vet had given her some valium to relax her, and once we got her someplace comfortable, she mostly slept for the rest of the night. She was uninterested in food or water, and we didn&#39;t push her to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, it became apparent that our cat was not recovering. For one thing, she was completely blind. For another, she was having difficulty walking, and even when standing still would often sway. When asleep, which was often, she seemed fine. When she decided she wanted to move, she would walk slowly in a near-straight line, listing slightly to the right, until she reached an obstacle (usually by running face-first into it). At that point, she would clumsily attempt to scale the obstacle, whether it was a shoe, a stool, or a wall. Several times she walked right through her own water bowl, not noticing her wet paws. She frequently became trapped in corners and would then yell, but it was apparent she didn&#39;t even really know what she was yelling about. She remained unresponsive to our voices, though we could tell by head and ear twitches she could at least hear. She did seem to take comfort in being on us. Whenever one of us sat with her on our chest, she would promptly fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night, Charlotte &amp;quot;fed&amp;quot; her by jamming a few fingers of wet food down her gullet. She swallowed them with difficulty but had no real interest in the food itself. We resorted to using a medication syringe to jet water into her mouth, which was the only way to get her to drink. She did not groom. She did not use the litter box. She did not really react to stimulus including being picked up or otherwise interacted with, other than the aforementioned falling asleep when she was on us. We tried anti-inflammatories in case her brain had swelled, and we tried phenobarbital, a common seizure suppressant, even though it mostly only works for epilepsy and Carbomb did not have epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, there was no improvement. In the afternoon I was able to get her to take a few licks from a plate of water by essentially holding it directly up to her face. I also crushed up several of her favorite treats and got her to take a few half-hearted bites of them. In all, she was unable to function as a cat. Still, we waited a bit longer, seeing the attempts to eat and drink as favorable signs. That night, twice, she walked directly over Baron, barely reacting when he growled and swatted at her except to pause and then begin walking forward again. We had to separate them, and we did our best to make the area she was in safe for her. Nonetheless, in the middle of the night, she got stuck in another corner underneath a set of shelves and ended up knocking over a planter filled with cactuses (she was luckily uninjured).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this time, we were in communication with the vet, who in the gentlest way possible had been repeatedly telling us that if Carbomb wasn&#39;t better by now, she was unlikely to get better. We discussed the possibility of the MRI, but even the vet thought it was a bad idea. The general anesthetic might kill a cat of that age and, truthfully, it didn&#39;t matter if it was a tumor or not – we weren&#39;t about to authorize brain surgery on a seventeen-year-old cat to find a potential tumor that, even if it existed and was removed, might not even improve her condition. It would be needlessly cruel to her to put her through that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday morning, we called it. We were at the vet at 9 AM. By 10 AM, Carbomb was gone. We each held her for a time as they prepped (she fell asleep on both of us, again). Then they sedated her, and left her with us to fall asleep for a final time, and then we both held her while they gave her the shot that would stop her heart. I&#39;m not sorry we did it—I believe it was the right and merciful thing to do—but I will carry the memory of watching that injection with me for the rest of my life. In a way, I&#39;m lucky. I&#39;m 45 years old and this was the first pet I&#39;ve ever had to put down. It was, I think, the hardest thing I have so far ever had to do in my entire life. I am completely unashamed to say that I broke down sobbing first when we got into that little room that I knew was the last place I&#39;d see her alive, and again when the act was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more background: I&#39;ve had a very difficult relationship with the cats. I am by nature more of a dog person – I want a pet, not a roommate. Cats are more of the latter. That said, I don&#39;t want a dog. They&#39;re too much work and too gross (I am also a pretty huge germaphobe, something I&#39;m working on). The cats, though, are also gross … something I wasn&#39;t prepared for when we adopted them - the amount of outside-the-litter-box puke, pee, and poop I&#39;ve had to deal with over the last decade and a half has been much, much higher than I anticipated. They also have strong personalities that sometimes clashed with mine - Carbomb in particular LOVED me so much that it was hard to deal with because if I interacted with her, she would get so amped up that she couldn&#39;t sit down, and then when she finally did, if I so much as shifted my legs, it would prompt another five minutes of circling. I was not sure, and remain unsure, that the cats were a net positive in my life, unless you include &amp;quot;made Charlotte happy&amp;quot; (which I do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did/do like them. They have brought many moments of amusement to my life. It&#39;s made me happy that they like to hang out on the couch in my office when Charlotte&#39;s not home. I absolutely love watching Charlotte interact with them. Also, I liked them as individuals. They each have their own personality, and I appreciated aspects of each of theirs. Baron is the easier cat from a personality standpoint, but I liked a lot about Carbomb as well. There are plenty of good things about owning cats, but left to my own devices, I might not ever adopt another one. Charlotte is a wonderful cat owner. I am not. I&#39;m not a good enough cat owner, and was especially not a good enough cat owner to the one that loved me best. I ignored her desire for attention too often, and I was grumpy with her more than I should&#39;ve been. I was not a good enough cat owner. That fact haunts me, now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, my view on pet adoption was that I&#39;d made a promise to these things that I would keep them as comfortable and content as I could, for as long as I could. Even when Carbomb went through a multi-year odyssey of semi-incontinence due to what ended up being a combination of factors (including a gluten allergy), I never seriously considered rehoming her. I wanted them to live long, happy lives &lt;em&gt;with us&lt;/em&gt;. That was the promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voluntarily telling a veterinarian to kill the pet I had shared sixteen years of my life with felt like a horrific betrayal of that promise. It still does. I know it was the right thing to do, but it doesn&#39;t change the way it feels, and the way it feels is terrible. But that&#39;s not really the worst of it. The worst of it is just the overwhelming fact that she is &lt;em&gt;not here&lt;/em&gt;. Every room I go into, there is some little reminder that Carbomb is &lt;em&gt;not here&lt;/em&gt; and is never going to be here again. She was in the world, and now she is not in the world, and she will never come back. I do not believe in a spirit, a soul, or an afterlife (I&#39;d love to, but I don&#39;t). I will not see my cat again. She is gone. And while I love her, and I hope I made it clear that I love her, especially in those last few days, it doesn&#39;t change anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have any good way to wrap up this post. I could write something pithy about how the beauty of these things is in their ephemerality, but I don&#39;t believe that. I don&#39;t agree with Kurzweil that without death, life is meaningless. I vehemently reject that notion. Carbomb mattered, and would have kept on mattering if she kept on living. That she matters in death, too, doesn&#39;t bring me any comfort. I&#39;d give a lot to put her on my lap again and let her circle for five stupid minutes while I roll my eyes and Charlotte laughs at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s like I said: this isn&#39;t anything that anyone who&#39;s lost a pet hasn&#39;t experienced. It will go away in time. I&#39;ll remember her fondly, and with some sadness, but not this acute grief that I&#39;m currently feeling. I know that. I&#39;ll get through it. But right now, I miss my cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said elsewhere: she was special. They&#39;re all special.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CWB Writing Newsletter - January 2023 | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2023-01-cwb-writing-newsletter-january-2023/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:15:16Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2023-01-cwb-writing-newsletter-january-2023/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 2023!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, can you believe it? Somehow we got through another circle around the sun, and here we are again in a new year, facing the long dark of January and February. Fortunately, I&#39;ve got exciting news to share, so let&#39;s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When last you heard from me (which was November, unless you&#39;re brand new to this newsletter), I&#39;d mentioned that I had a side project that was probably going to keep me away from writing for a bit. Well … that was put on hiatus, and I was absolutely dying to get started on the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/em&gt;, so I got started on the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/em&gt;). I&#39;m not going to tell you the name just yet, because it&#39;s a bit of a spoiler for the first book, but I&#39;ve been cranking away on it since December 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s perhaps not a great idea to be writing this book. I still haven&#39;t landed an agent for &lt;em&gt;Piety&lt;/em&gt; and it makes basically zero sense to write a sequel to a book that hasn&#39;t even secured representation, much less been bought by a publisher. But sometimes you just gotta write what you want to write, whether it makes the most sense or not. I&#39;ve skipped writing sequels to a bunch of other books, many of which I would really love to write sequels for, because I was trying to get an agent, but in this case I think Piety might be my best work overall and I was too excited to keep writing stories in that world to just walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably frustrating for you. &amp;quot;Great, he&#39;s writing a sequel we can&#39;t read to a book we can&#39;t read&amp;quot; … yeah. That&#39;s not so hot. So here&#39;s the deal: I will make you two promises. The first is that if I fail to secure representation for this trilogy, I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eventually release it independently. You&#39;ll get to read Piety the Knife, its sequel, and the closing book in the trilogy someday. The other promise: if I don&#39;t have an agent by this summer, I will begin work on releasing &lt;em&gt;Possessed&lt;/em&gt; as an indie title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t remember &lt;em&gt;Possessed&lt;/em&gt;? You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbwriting.com/books/&quot;&gt;learn more about it on my writing site&lt;/a&gt;, but for a quick summary: it&#39;s a contemporary fantasy book in the style of Christopher Moore, featuring a lot of humor in addition to my trademarked (not actually trademarked) blend of action and character development. It&#39;s about a young woman living in the Miami suburbs who accidentally gets possessed by a demon. Do hijinks ensue? They absolutely do. Does she get into some dangerous situations? She absolutely does! Does she survive the end of the book? Well, I hope to give you a chance to find out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yeah … &lt;em&gt;Untitled Piety Sequel That&#39;s Not Actually Untitled&lt;/em&gt;? Going really well. I haven&#39;t missed a single day while writing it, I&#39;m almost to 70,000 words, and I&#39;m averaging an absurd 2,300 words a day. Not sure if I can keep up that pace or not, but I&#39;m having an absolute blast with it at the moment and am on track to finish it up sometime in early February, assuming it comes in around 120,000-130,000 words, which feels about right for the plans I have for the plot! That means by the March newsletter, it should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a ton new here to report. The book is out with the agent who requested significant revisions, now that I&#39;ve made those revisions. I&#39;m hoping like hell she likes what I&#39;ve done and is ready to take me on as a client. I think it&#39;s likely, but not guaranteed, I&#39;ll hear back from her before the March newsletter. Fingers crossed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strike&gt;Book&lt;/strike&gt; Graphic Novel Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781632157096&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monstress&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://marjoriemliu.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Majorie Liu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sanatakeda.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sana Takeda&lt;/a&gt;, you are absolutely missing out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781632157096&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grab volume one from your local indie bookstore&lt;/a&gt; (or, if you must, I guess keep lining Jeff Bezos&#39;s pockets and use Amazon, but seriously … go indie)! You will not regret it, I promise you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catch you in March!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can get these updates before they hit the blog by subscribing to the newsletter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Explanation of My Issues With AI-Generated Images | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2022-12-on-ai-art/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2022-12-on-ai-art/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last few months have seen an explosion of AI-generated images, both those that are photorealistic and those that emulate various illustrators. There are a swarm of questions surrounding these images, so I thought I&#39;d tackle a few of those and then talk at slightly more length about why my opinion is what it is. So … the questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is AI-generate imagery ethical?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. Not in its current form, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Isn&#39;t AI-generated imagery the same as an artist who learns by studying, copying, and ultimately absorbing the work of others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. Not in its current form, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is AI-generated imagery &amp;quot;Art?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. Not in its current form, no. Also, who cares, because &amp;quot;what is art?&amp;quot; is among the most pointless, futile, and ultimately worthless questions one can ask. But if we must ask it, then going by not just my definition of &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; but any vaguely societally accepted definition of &amp;quot;art,&amp;quot; I repeat … not in its current form, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which begs a final question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Can AI-generated imagery BE &amp;quot;art?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A. Yes, absolutely, without question. It will get there, but it will not get there as fast as people think it will get there for one reason, and that reason is a single word, around which I&#39;m going to frame the entire rest of this post. That word is: &amp;quot;intent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to clear up is that &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; images are not made by AI. They are made by Machine Learning, which is the very early stages of a technology that may someday yield something like AI. Artificial Intelligence, which of course is what AI stands for, is still quite a ways off. Machine Learning is not an intelligence. It&#39;s a set of algorithms that can be given a task and, through a combination of training and model adjustments, can improve at that task over time. It&#39;s one of many building blocks that will be needed for true AI, but it&#39;s not AI. Machine Learning algorithms do not think. They cannot set their own goals, and what progress they make is limited to fairly straightforward trial and error, the results of which need to be validated by human beings (or validated against goals established by human beings, such as &amp;quot;finish this Mario level without dying&amp;quot;). So, for the rest of this post, we&#39;ll be replacing the &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; acronym with the much more accurate &amp;quot;ML.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we understand the difference between what we have (ML) and what will someday exist (AI), we can also understand where &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; comes in pretty rapidly, I think. Machine Learning does not have intent when it makes art. One can argue that the &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; is supplied by the human who provides the prompts to the ML image generator, but I think this is pretty facile. It&#39;s honestly amusing to see people on the internet bickering over prompt ownership, as if coming up with something like &amp;quot;Sexy fair-skinned lady with dragon horns and green eyes in the style of &lt;a href=&quot;https://rossdraws.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ross Draws&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; is a difficult creative exercise. The &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; here is not to produce a unique work of art through the culmination of one&#39;s experience, practice, training, skill, and (yes, for sure, for every human artist who has lived at least since first our ancestors scraped pictures of mammoths into cave walls) one&#39;s influences. The &amp;quot;intent&amp;quot; is to try and talk a machine into producing something that one finds visually pleasing - the machine itself has no intent beyond fulfilling the requirements of its programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common argument I&#39;ve seen in favor of ML-generated imagery as &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; is that human artists&#39; works are really no more than the sum of their influences, the same as a computer that&#39;s been trained on hundreds or thousands of images by various artists. Let&#39;s leave aside the ethics involved in taking an artist&#39;s work without their permission and using it to train a Machine Learning model, because those ethics are &lt;em&gt;spectacularly&lt;/em&gt; grim and have very little to do with a human artist sitting in a museum and making a reference drawing of an old masterwork (the closest analog I&#39;ve seen anyone come up with). Let&#39;s instead consider just the actual mechanics of this training, for both human beings and computers. Let&#39;s consider the claim that there&#39;s no difference between what the human is doing and what the machine is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human artists are unquestionably influenced by other artists, and arguing otherwise is a fool&#39;s game. Many of history&#39;s greatest masters spent years, if not decades, directly copying the work of older masters. All of the modern age&#39;s crop of incredible illustrators—folks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tommyarnoldart.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tommy Arnold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karlaortizart.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karla Ortiz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pepelarraz/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pepe Larraz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sanatakeda.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sana Takeda&lt;/a&gt; or a thousand other amazing artists—owe a great deal to their artistic influences. The people whose work they looked at that made them think &amp;quot;I want to draw/paint/etc like that.&amp;quot; This is not in doubt, and with any of these artists it&#39;s a guarantee that to this day, no matter how their personal styles have evolved, you can see the ghosts of those influences within them. So … what&#39;s the difference? The difference is intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me put it this way: when I go to draw a nose, sometimes I draw a nose that looks like a nose that an artist I like drew. Not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; like it, probably, in part because I don&#39;t have as much training or practice or skill as the artists I look up to, but close enough for government work. In this instance, what I&#39;m doing is very similar to the way Machine Learning operates. I&#39;m recalling (or looking directly at) how other artists have solved the problem of representing a human nose, and doing my best to impersonate that. While I am indeed operating with intent here, that intent being &amp;quot;I want to draw the nose in the cool way this other person does,&amp;quot; that intent at least resembles the operation of the ML algorithm, even if such an algorithm isn&#39;t really operating with that same intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s not the only way I draw a nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, what I do instead is draw the skull first. Then I layer the actual anatomy of the nose on top of that. The skull provides the nasal bones, and the rest is cartilage – the upper laterals, the nasal septal, the lateral crus, etc. Then there&#39;s flesh on top of that, which requires erasing a lot of the subsurface lines while still preserving the shapes that they generate in the flesh layed on top of them. I do this with intent: to understand the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; of drawing a nose. I do this to understand and solve the problem of representing this form in a way that will read as both anatomically correct and visually appealing to human eyes (within the scope of the drawing&#39;s style - manga faces are in no way anatomically correct but they &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; as correct, and visually appealing to many people, within the style of the art). I do this to establish muscle and visual memory that will allow me to solve this problem more reliably without having to take the intermediate steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I don&#39;t draw all of the underlying substructure, but neither do I draw a nose that comes from my personal memory bank. Sometimes I experiment with form, line weight, angle, shading … a dozen other variables. Sometimes I do this while looking at reference. Sometimes I do it from my own imagination. It&#39;s this exercise, in the long run, that truly establishes an artists&#39; style. It&#39;s the reason you can look at any piece of &lt;a href=&quot;https://loish.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Loish&lt;/a&gt; artwork and know, immediately, that it&#39;s hers – even while being able to see the influence of things like the Disney movies of the 90s clearly shining through. She is an amalgamation of her influences, but she is also something uniquely her own, because of the many millions of lines she&#39;s laid down over the course of years of practicing. Of drawing with intent. Loish&#39;s art is not, to simplify things absurdly for the sake of clarity, &amp;quot;Disney + Manga + Alfonse Mucha = Loish&amp;quot; but rather &amp;quot;Disney + Manga + Alfonse Mucha + &lt;strong&gt;Loish&lt;/strong&gt; = Loish.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine Learning-generated images are often beautiful. They&#39;re also often distinguishable from the artists on whose work they were trained, albeit usually because there is something uncanny or not-quite-right about them compared to work that was made with intent. Nonetheless, ML-generated images can be claimed to have a style that is their own, even if that style&#39;s influences are worn on its sleeve. I maintain that there is a significant difference between a style obtained solely by mashing together bits of data, and a style obtained by acting with intent, and I believe its at the core of the latter where &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; is typically found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machines will get there. They&#39;re going to get a lot of places, some of them very soon, some of them a little later, but they&#39;ll get there. It&#39;s going to be scary for most people, at some point. Your job, whatever your job is, will be threatened first by Machine Learning and then, later, by true artificial intelligence. My job as a software engineer, my writing, my illustration (amateur though it is) — all of these are already threatened by Machine Learning. I can&#39;t control that. What I can control is the work I choose to consume - what I look at, what I support, what I pay for. When the machines can deliver art made with intent, if I am still alive when they get there, I will reevaluate. For now, they cannot. I&#39;m sticking with human beings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CWB Writing Newsletter - November 2022 | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-november-2022/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-november-2022/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi There!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been another couple of months, so let&#39;s catch up, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When last we spoke, I was about to embark upon the third draft of &lt;em&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/em&gt;, my latest manuscript, at the request of an agent who&#39;s interested in representing me but didn&#39;t think the book was quite &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; yet. Well, I&#39;m pleased to say that the time since the last newsletter has been immensely productive, and the third draft of Piety the Knife is now finished. I honestly thought the second draft was really strong (and it seems agents agreed - it got the most attention of any book I&#39;ve ever written that didn&#39;t end up with offers of representation), but I think this one&#39;s even better. It solidifies a lot of things, gives further depth to the various characters, adjusts the pacing in several positive ways, and in general tells Piety&#39;s story in a way that I think (hope) is super-compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will it land me an agent? I have no idea! This business is crazy, and it&#39;s particularly crazy right now, because the industry got all backed up due to COVID, so now publishers are taking on fewer books, which means agents are signing fewer authors. Nonetheless, I remain optimistic. I think this is a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good book, and I hope I&#39;ll someday be able to get it into your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reminder: New Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the last newsletter, I finally did something with &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbwriting.com/&quot;&gt;CWBWriting.com&lt;/a&gt;. You can find all of my writing there, of course, but there&#39;s also a blog which I do occasionally update, and not only with these newsletters. My last post was some musing on Facebook&#39;s myriad failings. How can you possibly not want to check out content like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you should totally check it out. It&#39;s cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really, really liked &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781250854117&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nona the Ninth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, probably even more than I liked &lt;em&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/em&gt; and definitely more than I liked &lt;em&gt;Harrow the Ninth&lt;/em&gt; (which I still liked, don&#39;t get me wrong!). If you haven&#39;t read any of the Locked Tomb series by Tamsyn Muir, I definitely recommend them. If you&#39;ve read Gideon and Harrow but haven&#39;t gotten to Nona yet … get to Nona!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief Hiatus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So … I am weirdly actually itching to write something new right now (preferably the sequel to Piety but that would be getting ahead of myself). Unfortunately, I have some contract work I need to do in the evenings and on weekends, so I may have to take a short time off from writing. Like a month or two. That doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be a newsletter in January, though. Hopefully by then I&#39;ll have heard from the agent who&#39;s interested in Piety and, if I&#39;m lucky, it&#39;ll be good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not? Well, I have some other things up my sleeve. Mostly doves, though. And maybe a rabbit. Or one of those handkerchief chains that just keeps on going and going. But also some things related to writing. Stick around. Whatever happens, you&#39;ll be the first to hear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Facebook | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2022-10-on-facebook/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/2022-10-on-facebook/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is adapted from a series of tweets I made the other day. If musings like these interest you, maybe consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cwbuecheler/&quot;&gt;following me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of recent reports that Facebook is bleeding both users and revenue, I want to talk about the site and its slow slide into irrelevance, and why I believe the 2010s focus on “Engagement” as the most important metric for measuring site performance is responsible for that slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Engagement,” for those who don’t know, is measured by tracking EVERYTHING A USER DOES on a site and measuring which activities keep them on the page longer. Literally every single time you click, and probably even mouse over things on Facebook, you’re being measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about “The Algorithm” what they mean is actually a bunch of algorithms, which are just chunks of code that behave in certain ways. “The Algorithm” is code that looks at what content spikes “Engagement” and attempts to put that content in front of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a non-algorithmic aspect to hunting for “Engagement” – the entire company, whether it’s coders, content creators, marketers, whatever, become focused on building a site that generates “Engagement.” The reason for this is really very simple, and even make sense: The longer you keep users interacting with the site, the more ads they see and the more data on them you collect. Showing ads and selling your data to other companies is how Facebook makes money. So, from a purely profit-driven standpoint, courting “Engagement” makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the problem yet? It’s also pretty straightforward: “Engagement” is not the same thing as “Enjoyment.” This is something I’ve been harping on for years, because I believe that pursuing the former at the expense of the latter is a long-term problem. I also believe we’ve been seeing that problem blooming like a grotesque flower over at Facebook since well before the disastrous 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A curious trick of our brains is that we will engage with a LOT of content that ACTIVELY MAKES US UNHAPPY. Facebook courts this. Not because they want unhappy users, but because they don’t care. They want “Engaged” users, and what’s more engaging than fighting with people over the internet? Not much, except maybe participating in echo chambers that reaffirm our most deeply-held beliefs (another service Facebook happily provides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, people were spending more and more time on Facebook, but becoming unhappier and unhappier while doing so. This leads to a short-term spike in “Engagement,” but in the long term it undermines people’s desire to remain a part of the site. And, EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY, it leads to new people not wanting to join the site, because all they hear is how awful it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, because Facebook has focused all of this time on “Engagement” at the expense of “Enjoyment”, there is now an entire generation of internet users who hear “Facebook” and think: “That’s the place where all the old people hang out and yell at each other and are miserable.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement. Combine that with a Silicon-Valley-Libertarian ethos that refuses to do anything about right wing cesspools on the site, and you get … well, you get what Facebook is getting: a diminishing userbase as people leave the site and new users don’t come along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, is this the ONLY reason for Facebook’s troubles? No, certainly not, but I believe it’s a significant reason, and a strong cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this one. Thanks for sticking with me, if you did!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CWB Writing Newsletter - September 2022 | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-september-2022/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-september-2022/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the missing the July update. It turns out when you lose your job with five days&#39; notice (and three of those are a long weekend), you kind of go into scramble mode, and your hobbies and/or semi-professional work have to go on hold while you look for, find, interview for, accept, and start at a new job. Especially when you add a preexisting trip to France, getting COVID for the first time after two and a half years, and being the Best Man in a wedding into the mix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&#39;ve been busy. Which means a short update this month … but that&#39;s okay! Let&#39;s jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unending Agent Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I talked extensively about the agent search and how it works in the last newsletter. Not gonna rehash that here, but I will go over the major thing happening right now: I&#39;ve had an agent request revisions on my latest book, Piety the Knife. I meant to make them over the last two or three months but, well, the first paragraph of this email happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I&#39;m a bit more back in the saddle. I&#39;m once again going over all of the notes (the agent&#39;s and my own) and preparing to take a stab at a third draft of the book. I have no idea how long it&#39;s going to take me to round it into shape, and I have a lot of other stuff going on in my life right now, but with summer winding down I&#39;m hoping to find enough time to hack away at it. So, let&#39;s see where we are in two months. Hopefully much further along than reading notes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also kicking around ideas for two new books, because of course I am. One of them would be straight historical fiction with no fantasy elements (or very minor ones). The other would be a horror story but with a pretty significant twist that I don&#39;t want to discuss just yet. I&#39;m still figuring out how it would work! Probably won&#39;t get to either of those this year, but they&#39;ve definitely been rolling around in my brain while I run, or shower, or am doing stuff like mowing the lawn, which is how my books always start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Websiii-heee-iiitte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After literally years of owning CWBWriting.com, I finally put a website up there! It includes information on all of my books and stories, an occasionally-updated blog, some stuff about me, and so forth. Also it has a light and dark mode and will remember your preference, because what kind of web developer would I be if I didn&#39;t offer dark mode in 2022?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swing by! Check it out! Maybe subscribe to the RSS feed in case I ever post anything there that&#39;s not just a duplicate of this newsletter! Exclamation points!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And … that&#39;s really about it for this month. See you in November!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can get these updates before they hit the blog by subscribing to the newsletter!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to CWB Writing | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/welcome-to-cwb-writing/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/welcome-to-cwb-writing/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to CWB Writing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many failed attempts to get this site off the ground, I&#39;ve finally found the time and energy to get this site off the ground! I felt it was time that my writing had its own dedicated spot on the web, rather than existing as a tab on my personal site alongside such exciting information as what basketball team I like to root for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I intend to update this site semi-regularly with writing news, thoughts, tips, info, etc. At the very least, it&#39;ll get updated every couple of months when I post my bi-monthly writing newsletter, though I should point out that you&#39;ll get these at least a week early if you subscribe using the box that is either to your right (on larger screens) or down below (on phones and such).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I&#39;m working on some requested revisions to &lt;em&gt;Piety the Knife&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-may-2022/&quot;&gt;see this update&lt;/a&gt;) and starting to think about my next story. Right now I&#39;m kicking around a couple of ideas, one of which is the story of someone who isn&#39;t the CHOSEN ONE but hangs out with the CHOSEN ONE, and one of which is about the Late Bronze Age collapse and the mysterious &amp;quot;Sea People&amp;quot; who may&#39;ve caused it. Maybe I&#39;ll merge those two into one thing. Or maybe I&#39;ll write something else entirely. You never know until you start putting words on digital paper!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CWB Writing Newsletter - May 2022 | Post | CWB Writing</title>
    <link href="https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-may-2022/"/>
    <updated>2023-01-21T19:06:58Z</updated>
    <id>https://cwbwriting.com/posts/cwb-writing-newsletter-may-2022/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello There!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an interesting couple of months it&#39;s been. I don&#39;t have &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; news, but I do have &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; news, which is … well, not bad! Let&#39;s get to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Unending Agent Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s talk about the agent hunt. For those new to this newsletter or who&#39;ve forgotten how this goes, it works like this: I send out &amp;quot;queries&amp;quot; which are single page descriptions of the new book, usually along with some information about yourself. Most (but not all) agents also ask you to send a small sample of the book, ranging from the first five pages to the first three chapters. MOST queries end up in rejections (or &amp;quot;closed, no response&amp;quot; because some agents only respond when they want more). I follow a lot of agents on Twitter and many of them get over 1,000 queries in a given month. Ambitious agents might take on six or seven authors in a given &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;. The odds are always against the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the agent is interested, they will generally ask for a &amp;quot;partial&amp;quot; (more of the book but not the whole thing) or a &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; (the full manuscript). An agent who asked for a partial will either reject or, if interested, upgrade to a full. Once an agent has read the full, one of three things will happen: they will either pass on representing the work, they will ask for revisions, or they will offer representation. The latter is the goal, though it only represents one more step on a very long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SO … with all that in mind, let&#39;s talk numbers. I have sent out a whopping &lt;em&gt;seventy&lt;/em&gt; queries for my latest book, Piety the Knife, a dark fantasy novel. Of those queries, so far thirty-six have resulted in rejections with no page requests, and two in &amp;quot;closed, no response.&amp;quot; That cuts us down to thirty-two. Of which, 26 are still outstanding. That means six agents have so far requested at least a partial manuscript (in fact, I got five full requests and one partial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of those six have offered representation. One rejected on the partial. Three others rejected on the full. One is still outstanding but is probably a reject at this point. The final agent has requested revisions, but does believe that if I can get the story to where she thinks it needs to be to sell it, she would like to represent it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, this is a very good result. It&#39;s actually a spectacular result. Six requests for pages is the most I&#39;ve ever gotten on any book I&#39;ve ever queried, including Elixir, the novel that landed me my first agent. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of the agents who rejected after requesting the full sent personalized feedback saying they thought I was a talented writer and to make sure I query them with my next book if I&#39;m still seeking representation. That&#39;s a really good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the &amp;quot;revise and resubmit&amp;quot; (R&amp;amp;R) is the best sign of the bunch. This gives me an actual target. &amp;quot;If you can do what&#39;s needed, you will likely get an agent.&amp;quot; I spent over two hours on Zoom with the agent in question, and I&#39;m extremely confident that a) she&#39;s well read in the genres I write, b) she&#39;s very passionate about the genres I write, and c) she would be an excellent champion for the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now: the hard part. Rewrites. I&#39;ve spent the past couple of weeks working on a plan to get the book into shape, taking into account her feedback, her assistant&#39;s feedback, my wife&#39;s thoughts, and my own gut instincts. I&#39;m just about ready to begin chopping, adding, and changing. I don&#39;t expect the process to be lengthy, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; expect it to be difficult. Writing is hard work. But this is as close as I&#39;ve been in a while to finding representation for my books, and the goal remains the same: get an agent, get a book sold to publishers, get that book on the shelves. I&#39;ve wanted it since I was eleven years old. Gonna keep pursuing it till it happens, or I&#39;m dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got this month. See you in July, hopefully with good news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Chris&lt;/p&gt;
