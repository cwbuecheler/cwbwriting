#### So, what are you all about, Chris?

I'm flattered, truly. Let's start with my standard author bio:

> Christopher Buecheler is a novelist, a web developer, an award-winning amateur mixologist, a developing illustrator, a musician, an enjoyer of video games, and an NBA enthusiast. He lives a semi-nomadic existence with his wonderful French wife. Currently they reside in Saint-Cloud, France, just outside of Paris.

Aside from all that, I'm in my late-forties, I listen to a fairly narrow spectrum of mostly rock music, I work out and run on weekdays, I'm vocally progressive, and I spend too much time on BlueSky.

#### Semi-Nomadic?

Not counting moves to a new place within the same city, I've lived in thirteen towns across six states and one other country: Massachusetts, New York (upstate and city), California, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Rhode Island, and France. I also travel frequently, particularly to Europe. I regularly work and write on these trips, so as a whole the lifestyle feels fairly nomadic. And we're about to move to a new town in France this summer.

#### What about this web developer stuff?

I've been designing and building websites professionally for twenty-five years. It pays the bills, and it's also something I actually enjoy doing. I designed and built this site using custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Markdown, and the static site generator Eleventy. If you want to learn more about my work, you can check out <a href="https://sloebrace.com" target="_blank">my professional site</a>.

#### Cool, cool. And the hobbies?

You can learn about all of this stuff in more depth at <a href="https://cwbuecheler.com" target="_blank">cwbuecheler.com</a> but here's the summary: In my spare time, I like to attempt to do many things decently instead of a few things well (and also play a lot of video games). To that end, in addition to the web stuff, which is a job, and the writing, which is basically a second job, I also regularly work on my drawing skills using an iPad Pro and an Apple pencil and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cwbuecheler/" target="_blank">post the results to instagram</a>, and I periodically play my guitars (An <a href="https://www.chorder.com/electric-guitars/epiphone/elitist-les-paul-standard-plus-234" target="_blank">Epiphone Elitest Les Paul Standard Plus</a>, a <a href="https://www.taylorguitars.com/guitars/acoustic/214ce" target="_blank">Taylor 214CE</a>, and a <a href="https://glguitars.com/product/l-2000-2/" target="_blank">G&amp;L Tribute L-2000</a>). I don't currently have a drum set, because I don't currently have a place to put a drum set, but I hope someday to rectify both situations. The cocktailing has taken a backseat in recent years. I mean, I still _drink_ them, but I used to write <a href="https://www.primermagazine.com/author/christopher-buecheler" target="_blank">cocktail and spirits articles for Primer Magazine</a>, and I ran a nightly cocktail blog, <a href="https://drinkshouts.com" target="_blank">DrinkShouts</a>, for a while, which also allowed me to learn a good bit about photography, including the fact that I didn't like photography enough to continue pursuing it as a hobby! I also, of course, read frequently, especially in the genres in which I write.

Oh, and the video games thing. Here are my top ten ever and my current favorites, which should give you a good look into my preferences:
