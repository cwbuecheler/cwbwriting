### Praise for The 2 AM Trilogy

> "This is such an amazing series with a variety of different types of vampires. Two is an extraordinary girl, rising from a dark place in her life, growing through bad experiences and hard times, and becoming a powerful person. The people in her life are equally important, each shaping the world where vampires lurk in plain sight. The people that hunt them are viscous and have acquired a powerful weapon, and it is up to Two and her friends to find a way to survive."
