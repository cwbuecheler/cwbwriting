### Non-Fiction

On occasion, I've been known to do some writing in the non-fiction realm. Specifically, I wrote a lot of video game articles for the sadly now-defunct GameSpy and CrispyGamer websites (RIP to both), and over 100 cocktail articles for Primer Magazine. Those articles still exist, so I've linked a handful below, along with the general archive of my work.
