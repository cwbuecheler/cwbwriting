### Short Stories

While the vast majority of my output is longform, I do occasionally produce short fiction. Here are some examples.

#### Erinyes

_Molly Thompson is a recovering heroin addict who just wants to graduate from high school and attend NYU. When her best friend is hurt by a hulking classmate, Molly calls in her friends to extract payment in the only currency that matters to them: blood._

Erinyes is a short story set in the same universe as the vampire books in my 2 AM trilogy. It stars Two's friend Molly, and features a few appearances from other familiar characters. It is **not recommended** that you read this story before finishing the trilogy. You can snag it from the following eBook retailers for the low, low price of 99 cents!
